# cutoff.scATOMIC

This is a fork of Marc Choisy's package [cutoff](https://github.com/choisy/cutoff).
It was generated to change the name of the package to avoid conflicts with the CRAN package cutoff.
This is an R package that implements the method used in Trang et al. (2015). It fits a finite mixture model (Schlattman 2009)
to a bimodal distribution using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Do and Batzoglou 2008). Confidence interval of the
mixture parameter is found using the method of Oakes (1999). The fitted finite mixture model is then used to calculate a cutoff
value that separates the data in two groups, given a type-1 error to belong to one of the two modes.
